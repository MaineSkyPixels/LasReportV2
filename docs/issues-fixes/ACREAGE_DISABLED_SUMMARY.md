# Acreage Calculation - Re-enabled with Convex Hull Option ✅

## Status Update (October 20, 2025)

Acreage calculations are now **fully active and enhanced** with dual-method support.

## What Changed

### Before
- Acreage calculation: ⚠️ Disabled
- Reason: Discrepancy with KML-based values
- Display: No acreage shown

### After (Current)
- **Bounding Box Acreage**: ✅ Always enabled (fast)
- **Convex Hull Acreage**: ✅ Optional (more accurate)
- **Display**: Both shown in reports when convex hull is enabled
- **User Control**: Checkbox to enable/disable detailed acreage

## Implementation Details

### Re-enabled Code
- `processor.py`: Bounding box acreage re-enabled (uncommented)
- `processor.py`: Convex hull acreage added (new method)
- `report_generator.py`: Acreage display re-enabled (both methods)

### New Dependencies
- `laspy==2.21.3` - For reading point coordinates
- `scipy==1.13.0` - For convex hull computation

### GUI Changes
- New checkbox: "Calculate detailed acreage using convex hull (slower but more accurate)"
- Info text: Explains convex hull vs bounding box difference
- Defaults to OFF for performance

## How It Works

1. **Bounding Box** (always):
   - Simple rectangle from min/max coordinates
   - Very fast (< 1ms)
   - May overestimate for scattered points

2. **Convex Hull** (optional):
   - True polygon boundary of point distribution
   - Slower (100ms-2s depending on file size)
   - More accurate representation of survey area

3. **Results Shown**:
   - Summary report: Shows acreage column with both values
   - Details report: Shows acreage with method indicator
   - Hover over values to see which method was used

## Fallback Handling

If convex hull calculation fails, system automatically falls back to bounding box:
- Files with < 3 points
- Colinear point patterns (degenerate hull)
- Very large files (> 2GB)
- If laspy or scipy not installed

## Next Steps

1. Run application with sample LAS files
2. Compare convex hull acreage with KML flight plan data
3. Verify accuracy improvement
4. Adjust if needed based on comparison

## Files Modified

- `processor.py` - Acreage enabled + convex hull added
- `report_generator.py` - Display updated for both methods
- `gui.py` - Added checkbox option
- `main.py` - Pass flag through workflow
- `requirements.txt` - Added laspy and scipy
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
