4. Files processed in parallel (4 at a time):
   - Run lasinfo on each file
   - Parse output for metrics
   - Update progress in real-time
   ↓
5. Generate HTML reports:
   - summary.html (overview with aggregate stats)
   - lasdetails.html (complete technical details)
   ↓
6. Save logs to .las_analysis_logs/ directory
