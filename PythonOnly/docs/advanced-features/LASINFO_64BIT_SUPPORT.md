# 64-bit lasinfo Auto-Detection Support

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and Ready

---

## Overview

The application now automatically detects and uses 64-bit `lasinfo64` when available, enabling processing of very large LAS files (>2GB, 2+ billion points).

---

## Problem Solved

**32-bit lasinfo limitations:**
- Maximum file size: ~2GB
- Maximum points: ~2 billion
- Memory addressing limited to 4GB
- Fails on larger files

**64-bit lasinfo advantages:**
- Unlimited file size
- Unlimited point clouds
- Full memory addressing
- Handles enterprise-scale datasets

---

## How It Works

### Auto-Detection Logic

On startup, the application:

1. **Checks for 64-bit first** (`lasinfo64`)
   - Logs: "Using 64-bit lasinfo - supports files >2GB"
   - Uses 64-bit if available

2. **Falls back to 32-bit** (`lasinfo`)
   - Logs: "Using 32-bit lasinfo - limited to files <2GB"
   - Uses 32-bit as fallback

3. **Raises error if neither found**
   - Clear message with install instructions
   - Directs to https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/

### Implementation

```python
def _detect_lasinfo_command(self, prefer_64bit: bool = True) -> str:
    """Detect best available lasinfo command"""
    
    if prefer_64bit and shutil.which('lasinfo64'):
        logger.info("Using 64-bit lasinfo (lasinfo64)")
        return 'lasinfo64'
    
    if shutil.which('lasinfo'):
        logger.info("Using 32-bit lasinfo")
        return 'lasinfo'
    
    raise FileNotFoundError("lasinfo not found in PATH")
```

### Large File Logging

When processing files > 1GB, the application logs:
```
INFO | LASAnalysis | Processing large file: huge_cloud.las (1254.3 MB) using lasinfo64
```

This helps users understand when 64-bit mode is active.

---

## Configuration

### Default Behavior
- **Automatic 64-bit preference**: Enabled by default
- **Transparent operation**: Works without user configuration

### Force 32-bit (if needed)
```python
processor = LASProcessor(prefer_64bit=False)
```

### Check Detection at Runtime
The log output shows which version is active:
```
DEBUG | LASAnalysis | lasinfo_cmd=lasinfo64  # 64-bit detected
DEBUG | LASAnalysis | lasinfo_cmd=lasinfo    # 32-bit fallback
```

---

## Installation Guide

### To Use 64-bit Support

1. **Download 64-bit LAStools**
   - Visit: https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/
   - Download the 64-bit version for your OS

2. **Install LAStools**
   - Windows: Run installer, adds to PATH automatically
   - Linux/Mac: Extract to /usr/local/bin or similar

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Windows PowerShell: `Get-Command lasinfo64`
   - Linux/Mac: `which lasinfo64`

4. **Application Detects Automatically**
   - No configuration needed
   - Application will use `lasinfo64` when available

### System PATH Requirements

For auto-detection to work, `lasinfo64` must be:
- In system PATH
- Executable (chmod +x on Linux/Mac)
- Version 2018+ (includes 64-bit)

## Performance Characteristics

### File Processing Speed

| Aspect | 32-bit | 64-bit |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Small files (<100MB) | Fast | Fast |
| Medium files (100MB-1GB) | Good | Good |
| Large files (1GB-2GB) | Slow/Stable | Stable |
| >2GB files | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| 2+ billion points | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |

### Speed Difference

**Note**: 64-bit doesn't process faster, it just **enables larger files**.
- Speed is same for comparable file sizes
- Benefit is **reliability** for enterprise datasets

### Memory Behavior

- **32-bit**: 4GB memory addressing limit
- **64-bit**: Unlimited memory addressing
- Both: Memory usage depends on file size (proportional)

---

## Error Handling

### Graceful Fallback

If 64-bit fails, application falls back to 32-bit:
```
WARNING | LASAnalysis | 64-bit lasinfo failed, falling back to 32-bit
```

### Clear Error Messages

If neither version available:
```
FileNotFoundError: lasinfo command not found in PATH
For large files (>2GB), ensure lasinfo64 is available

```

## Logging Details

### Initialization
```
DEBUG | LASProcessoritialized: ... lasinfo_cmd=lasinfo64
INFO | Using 64-bit lasinfo (lasinfo64) - supports files >2GB
```

### Large File Processing
```
INFO | Processing large file: huge.las (2150.5 MB) using lasinfo64
```

### File Size Threshold
- **Logged files**: > 1000 MB (1GB+)
- **Typical files**: Not logged (< 1000 MB)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Application uses 32-bit instead of 64-bit

**Check**:
1. Is 64-bit LAStools installed?
   ```bash
   lasinfo64 --version   # Should work
   ```

2. Is `lasinfo64` in PATH?
   ```bash
   which lasinfo64       # Linux/Mac
   Get-Command lasinfo64 # PowerShell
   ```

3. Check application logs
   ```
   DEBUG | lasinfo_cmd=lasinfo  # Shows 32-bit is being used
   ```

**Solution**:
- Install 64-bit LAStools
- Add installation directory to PATH
- Restart application

### Issue: Application fails with error

**Check application log for**:
```
lasinfo command not found in PATH
```

**Solution**:
- Install any version of LAStools (32 or 64-bit)
- Ensure it's in PATH
- Restart application

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Works with existing 32-bit installations
- No code changes needed for users
- Automatic detection transparent to users
- Can force 32-bit if needed via parameter

---

## Technical Details

### Detection Method
- Uses Python `shutil.which()` for PATH searching
- One-time detection at processor initialization
- Cached in `self.lasinfo_cmd` for all operations

### Command Substitution
```python
# Before: hardcoded
result = subprocess.run(["lasinfo", ...])

# After: dynamic
result = subprocess.run([self.lasinfo_cmd, ...])
```

### Cross-Platform
- Windows: Searches for `lasinfo64.exe` and `lasinfo.exe`
- Linux/Mac: Searches for `lasinfo64` and `lasinfo`
- Works with `.exe` extension on Windows automatically

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel 64-bit processing**: Use `-cores` flag with 64-bit
2. **Adaptive detection**: Auto-select based on file size
3. **Version logging**: Report exact lasinfo version used
4. **Performance metrics**: Track 32-bit vs 64-bit usage
