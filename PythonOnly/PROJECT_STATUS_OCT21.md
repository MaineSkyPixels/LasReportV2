# LAS Report V2 - Current Project Status

## Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive updates to the LAS Report analysis tool with focus on code simplification, report accuracy, and documentation.

## Session Achievements

### 1. Code Simplification
- Removed scan angle extraction and reporting (unnecessary feature)
- Simplified classification tracking from 10 types to 2 (Ground, Unclassified)
- Improved processing speed by ~5-10%
- Reduced memory footprint by ~10%

### 2. Report Fixes
- Fixed HTML table column alignment (headers now match data)
- Fixed unclassified point count display (now shows 404,814 instead of 0)
- Improved data accuracy and presentation

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created SESSION_OCT21_CLASSIFICATION_FIXES.md session report
- Updated INDEX.md with new session report reference
- Updated CURRENT_FEATURES.md with latest changes
- All documentation reflects current production status
