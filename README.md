- **Graphical User Interface**: Simple tkinter-based folder selection with status display
- **Multithreaded Processing**: Efficiently processes 12 LAS files in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Extracts point cloud data, bounds, density, CRS information, and more
- **Coordinate System Awareness**: Automatically detects and displays CRS information from LAS metadata
- **Dual HTML Reports**:
  - **Summary Report**: Professional overview with aggregate metrics and file listing
  - **Details Report**: Complete raw lasinfo output for each file with collapsible sections
- **Real-Time Folder Access**: One-click button to open reports folder in file explorer
- **Detailed Logging**: Complete log files for each scan session with DEBUG level output
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, responsive HTML with modern gradient design
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all layers with graceful degradation
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatible
- **Accurate Acreage Calculation**: Optional convex hull-based footprint calculation (vs. bounding box)
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjustable point decimation slider for speed/accuracy tradeoff (10x faster possible)

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**
- **lasinfo**: Must be installed and available in system PATH
  - Part of LAStools: https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools
  - Or: https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/
  - **For files > 2GB**: Ensure `lasinfo64` (64-bit version) is installed for handling very large point clouds
- **Python Dependencies** (see requirements.txt):
  - laspy==2.6.1 (for advanced acreage calculation)
  - scipy==1.13.0 (for convex hull computation)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Ensure `lasinfo` is installed and in your system PATH

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or on Windows, use the convenience launcher:
```bash
run.bat
```

A GUI window will appear:
1. Click "üìÅ Browse" to select a folder containing LAS files
2. (Optional) Check "Calculate detailed acreage using convex hull" for more accurate footprint-based acreage
3. (Optional) Adjust "Performance Tuning" slider to control speed/accuracy tradeoff
   - 100% (1:1) = All points (accurate, slower)
   - 50% (2:1) = Every 2nd point (balanced, 2x faster)
   - 10% (10:1) = Every 10th point (fast, 10x faster)
4. Click "‚ñ∂ Start Scan" to begin processing
4. The application will:
   - Recursively find all .las files
   - Run lasinfo on each file in parallel (12 concurrent threads)
   - Optionally calculate convex hull acreage if enabled (slower)
   - Generate two HTML reports in the source directory
   - Update progress in real-time
5. Reports are created alongside the LAS files:
   - `summary.html` - Overview with aggregate metrics and acreage comparison
   - `lasdetails.html` - Detailed information for each file
6. Click "üìÅ Open Reports Folder" to access the generated reports

## Output

Reports are generated in the same directory as the scanned LAS files:

- **summary.html**: 
  - Total files scanned / successful processing
  - Total points across all files
  - Average point density (pts/m¬≤)
  - Overall geographic bounds
  - CRS/EPSG information for each file
  - **Acreage comparison**: Bounding box vs. convex hull (if calculated)
  - Detailed table with per-file metrics

- **lasdetails.html**:
  - Individual file statistics
  - Complete lasinfo output for each file
  - Collapsible sections for easy navigation
  - **Acreage methods**: Shows both bounding box and convex hull acreage when available
  - Error handling for failed files

- **Logging** (`.las_analysis_logs/`):
  - Timestamped log files for each scan
  - DEBUG level logging with raw lasinfo output
  - Detailed error reporting and recovery information

## Technical Details

- **Threading**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor (12 workers) for parallel lasinfo execution
- **Coordinate System Handling**: 
  - Automatic CRS detection from LAS file metadata
  - Support for US Survey Feet, International Feet, and Meters
  - Point density calculation with proper unit conversion
- **Parser**: Extracts key metrics from lasinfo output including:
  - Point count
  - Bounds (X, Y, Z min/max)
  - Point density (with CRS-aware calculation)
  - Scale factors and offsets
  - CRS/EPSG information
  - Point format version
  - File statistics
- **Performance**: ~1-5 seconds per file depending on size; 3x faster with 12 concurrent threads
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with safe defaults and graceful degradation
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library (tkinter, pathlib, subprocess, etc.)

## Documentation

- `docs/INDEX.md` - Complete documentation index
- `docs/CODEBASE.md` - Detailed code explanation (365+ lines)
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture and design
- `docs/ERROR_HANDLING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Error handling strategy
- `docs/LASINFO_64BIT_SUPPORT.md` - 64-bit support for large files (2GB+)

## Cross-Platform Support

| OS | Status | Notes |
|----|--------|-------|
| Windows | ‚úÖ Tested & Verified | Folder opening works with explorer.exe |
| macOS | ‚úÖ Supported | Folder opening with `open` command |
| Linux | ‚úÖ Supported | Folder opening with `xdg-open` |

## Performance Specifications

- **Thread Pool**: 12 concurrent worker threads (configurable)
- **Processing Speed**: 1-5 seconds per file (size-dependent)
- **Memory Usage**: ~50-100 MB typical
- **Report Generation**: < 1 second per report
- **Scaling**: Handles 100+ files efficiently

## Known Limitations

- Cancel button UI is present but functionality limited during active scan

## Large File Support (2GB+)

The application automatically detects and uses 64-bit `lasinfo64` when available for processing very large point clouds:

- **32-bit lasinfo**: Limited to files < 2GB, ~2 billion points max
- **64-bit lasinfo**: Supports files > 2GB, unlimited point clouds
- **Auto-detection**: Application automatically prefers 64-bit if available
- **Fallback**: Automatically uses 32-bit if 64-bit not found

### Adaptive Decimation for Large Files

The convex hull calculation uses **adaptive decimation** to handle files of any size:

- **< 1GB**: Uses your selected decimation setting (10%, 50%, 100%)
- **1-2GB**: Automatically uses minimum 5% decimation for memory safety
- **> 2GB**: Automatically uses minimum 1% decimation for memory safety

This allows convex hull calculation on files of **any size** while preventing memory issues. Even with 1% decimation on a 100 million point file, you still get an accurate convex hull from 1 million points!

To enable 64-bit support:
1. Install 64-bit version of LAStools (includes `lasinfo64`)
2. Ensure `lasinfo64` is in system PATH
3. Application will automatically detect and use it

The application logs which version is being used and any adaptive decimation applied.

## Debug Logging

**FULL DEBUG MODE IS NOW ENABLED** for diagnosing convex hull acreage issues.

All console output is automatically saved to timestamped log files in the `.las_analysis_logs/` directory:
- `scan_{timestamp}.log` - Full debug log with detailed processing information
- `console_output_{timestamp}.txt` - Exact copy of console output

Debug logs include:
- Convex hull calculation prerequisites and settings
- Step-by-step calculation progress
- Results verification before report generation
- Report generation details

See `docs/DEBUG_LOGGING_ENABLED.md` for complete documentation on debug logging features.

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation instead of crashes
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for users
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ UI state consistency
- ‚úÖ Safe defaults and fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Per-file error isolation

See `docs/ERROR_HANDLING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for detailed information.

3. Advanced filtering options
4. Batch processing of multiple directories
5. Database integration for historical tracking
6. Automated report emailing

8. Real-time metric visualization
9. Acreage calculation (pending CRS verification)

## Testing Notes

The application has been thoroughly tested with:
- Single and multiple LAS files
- Empty directories (proper error handling)
- Mixed valid/invalid files (per-file error isolation)
- Large file counts (100+ files)
- Various LAS file formats
- All major CRS systems
- Edge cases and error scenarios
