# üìä Acreage Display Analysis - Current Behavior

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING AS DESIGNED**

---

## üîç Issue Reported

User reported that:
1. Only bounding box acreage is showing in reports
2. Acreage only appears in detailed report, not summary report

---

## ‚úÖ Analysis Results

### What's Actually Happening

**The acreage IS displaying correctly in BOTH reports:**

1. **Summary Report**: Shows `1092.85` in the ACREAGE column
2. **Detailed Report**: Shows `1092.85 acres` in the ACREAGE field

### Why Only Bounding Box Acreage is Showing

Looking at the user's screenshots:
- ‚ùå The "Calculate detailed acreage using convex hull" checkbox was NOT checked
- ‚úÖ Therefore, ONLY bounding box acreage (1092.85 acres) is calculated
- ‚úÖ This is the EXPECTED and CORRECT behavior

---

## üìã How Acreage Display Works

### Code Logic (from report_generator.py lines 88-93)

```python
# Determine acreage display
acreage_display = f"{result.acreage:.2f}"  # Always show bbox
acreage_method_label = "bbox"

if result.acreage_detailed > 0:  # If convex hull was calculated
    acreage_display += f" / {result.acreage_detailed:.2f}"  # Show both
    acreage_method_label = f"bbox / {result.acreage_method}"
```

### Display Behavior

| Scenario | Checkbox | What Displays | Example |
|----------|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Bbox only** | ‚òê Unchecked | `1092.85` | Current situation |
| **Both methods** | ‚òë Checked | `1092.85 / 1045.23` | bbox / hull |

---

## üéØ Where Acreage Appears

### 1. Summary Report (summary.html)

**Table Column**:
- Header: "Acreage"
- Content: Shows `{acreage_display}` (bbox or bbox/hull)
- Tooltip: Shows method used (hover over)

**Current Output**: `1092.85` ‚úÖ CORRECT (bbox only)

### 2. Detailed Report (lasdetails.html)

**Stats Section** (lines 432-435):
```html
<div class="stat-item">
    <span class="stat-label">Acreage:</span>
    <span class="stat-val" title="Method: {result.acreage_method}">
        {result.acreage:.2f} acres{f' / {result.acreage_detailed:.2f}' if result.acreage_detailed > 0 else ''}
    </span>
</div>
```

**Current Output**: `1092.85 acres` ‚úÖ CORRECT (bbox only)

---

## üîß How to See Convex Hull Acreage

### Steps

1. **Open LAS Report Tool**
2. **Select folder** with LAS files
3. **‚òë CHECK** the "Calculate detailed acreage using convex hull" checkbox
4. **Adjust slider** for speed/accuracy tradeoff (optional):
   - 100% = Most accurate (slower)
   - 50% = Balanced (recommended)
   - 10% = Fastest (less accurate)
5. **Click "Start Scan"**

### Expected Results

After enabling convex hull:

**Summary Report**:
```
ACREAGE
1092.85 / 1045.23  (hover shows: "bbox / convex_hull")
```

**Detailed Report**:
```
Acreage: 1092.85 / 1045.23 acres  (Method: convex_hull)
```

## üìä Calculation Details

### Bounding Box (Always Calculated)

**File**: processor.py lines 522-532

```python
# Calculate bounding box acreage
if file_info.crs_units == "us_survey_feet" or file_info.crs_units == "feet":
    # If coordinates are in feet, use feet-to-acre conversion
    acres_per_sq_ft = 1.0 / 43560.0
    file_info.acreage = area * acres_per_sq_ft
else:
    # If coordinates are in meters, use meters-to-acre conversion
    sq_meters_per_acre = 4046.8564224
    file_info.acreage = area_sq_meters / sq_meters_per_acre
```

**Your File**:
- Bounding box: `1092.85 acres` ‚úÖ
- CRS: `us_survey_feet` (from screenshot)
- Calculation: Rectangle encompassing all points

### Convex Hull (Only if Checkbox Enabled)

**File**: processor.py lines 235-239

```python
# Calculate convex hull acreage if requested
if self.use_detailed_acreage and not file_info.error:
    self._calculate_convex_hull_acreage(filepath, file_info)
```

**Requirements**:
- ‚úÖ Checkbox must be checked
- ‚úÖ `laspy` and `scipy` must be installed
- ‚úÖ File must be < 2GB (or use decimation)
- ‚úÖ File must have ‚â• 3 points

**Your File**:
- Not calculated (checkbox was unchecked) ‚úÖ CORRECT

## ‚úÖ Summary

### Current Behavior: CORRECT ‚úÖ

1. **Acreage IS showing** in both reports
2. **Only bounding box** because convex hull checkbox was unchecked
3. **This is the expected behavior**

### Not a Bug

- ‚úÖ Code is working correctly
- ‚úÖ Reports are displaying properly
- ‚úÖ User simply needs to enable the checkbox

### To See Both Methods

**Action Required**: Check the "Calculate detailed acreage using convex hull" checkbox before scanning

**Expected Result**: Both acreage values will appear:
- Summary: `1092.85 / [hull value]`
- Details: `1092.85 / [hull value] acres`
