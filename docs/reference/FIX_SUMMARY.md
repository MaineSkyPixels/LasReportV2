# Fix Summary - LAS File Data Parsing

## Problem
Reports were being generated but contained no data except file sizes. All metrics (point count, bounds, density) showed as 0 or 0.00.

## Root Cause
The regex-based parsing in `processor.py` was using patterns that didn't match the actual lasinfo output format. The patterns were too specific and flexible at the same time, causing most matches to fail.

### Original Issues:
1. **Format mismatch**: Expected format like "number of point records 88977761" but actual format was "number of point records:    88977761"
2. **Multi-line parsing**: Expected separate lines for X and Y bounds, but actual format was "min x y z:  2960638.3326 340245.2090 -68.1606" (all on one line)
3. **Encoding issues**: lasinfo output contained special characters that caused subprocess decode errors

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Output Capture** (processor.py, line ~70-80)
```python
# Before: Used text=True which failed on encoding
result = subprocess.run(
    ["lasinfo", str(filepath)],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=300
)

# After: Use bytes and decode manually with error handling
result = subprocess.run(
    ["lasinfo", str(filepath)],
    capture_output=True,
    text=False,
    timeout=300
)

if result.stdout:
    output = result.stdout.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
elif result.stderr:
    output = result.stderr.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
```

### 2. **Rewrote Parsing Logic** (processor.py, line ~110-180)
Changed from regex-based matching to simple string splitting on colons and spaces:

```python
# Parse "number of point records:    88977761"
if 'number of point records:' in line_lower:
    parts = line_stripped.split(':')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        file_info.point_count = int(parts[1].strip().replace(',', ''))

# Parse "min x y z:  2960638.3326 340245.2090 -68.1606"
if line_lower.startswith('min x y z:'):
    parts = line_stripped.split(':')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        values = parts[1].strip().split()
        if len(values) >= 3:
            file_info.min_x = float(values[0])
            file_info.min_y = float(values[1])
            file_info.min_z = float(values[2])
```

### 3. **Added Point Density Calculation** (processor.py, line ~180-185)
Since lasinfo doesn't directly provide point density, we calculate it from bounds and point count:

```python
if file_info.min_x != file_info.max_x and file_info.min_y != file_info.max_y and file_info.point_count > 0:
    area = abs(file_info.max_x - file_info.min_x) * abs(file_info.max_y - file_info.min_y)
    if area > 0:
        file_info.point_density = file_info.point_count / area
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
Point Count:      0
Point Density:    0.00
Bounds:           0.00 to 0.00
```

### After Fix:
```
Point Count:      88,977,761
Point Density:    89.25 pts/m²
Bounds:           2960638.33 to 2961572.72
```

## Data Extracted Per File
Each LAS file now correctly extracts:
- ✓ Point count: 88,977,761 points
- ✓ Scale factors: 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001
- ✓ Offsets: 2961000, 340000, 0
- ✓ Geographic bounds: X, Y, Z min/max values
- ✓ Point format: Format 3
- ✓ Point density: Calculated from bounds (89.25 pts/m²)
- ✓ CRS information: NAD83(2011) / Maine West (ftUS)
- ✓ Raw lasinfo output: Complete capture for details report

## Aggregate Statistics (9 Sample Files)
- **Total Files**: 9
- **Total Points**: 419,322,300
- **Average Density**: 57.92 pts/m²
- **Total Data Size**: 13,596.51 MB
