# Acreage Calculation Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive acreage calculation to the LAS File Analysis Tool, providing land area measurements in both summary and detailed reports.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Acreage Field Added
Added `acreage` field to `LASFileInfo` dataclass:
```python
acreage: float = 0.0  # Total acreage covered by each file
```

### 2. Calculation Logic
Acreage is calculated from geographic bounds (X, Y coordinates) with full unit awareness:

**For US Survey Feet coordinates:**
```
Area (sq ft) = |max_x - min_x| × |max_y - min_y|
Acreage = Area (sq ft) / 43,560 sq ft per acre
```

**For International Feet:**
```
Area (sq ft) = |max_x - min_x| × |max_y - min_y|
Acreage = Area (sq ft) / 43,560 sq ft per acre
```

**For Meters:**
```
Area (sq m) = |max_x - min_x| × |max_y - min_y|
Acreage = Area (sq m) / 4,046.8564224 sq m per acre
```

### 3. Conversion Constants Used
- **1 US Survey Acre** = 43,560 square feet (exact)
- **1 Acre** = 4,046.8564224 square meters (precise international definition)
- Files automatically detect coordinate units (feet vs meters) and use appropriate conversion

### 4. Aggregate Statistics
Added to aggregate calculation:
```python
total_acreage = sum(r.acreage for r in valid_results)
```

## Report Integration

**New Stat Card:**
```

Total Files:           9
Total Points:          419,322,300
Total Acreage:         170.21 acres ✅
Average Density:       623.44 pts/m²
Coverage Area:         Full survey area = 2.66 sq miles
                       (170.21 acres ÷ 640 acres/sq mi)

## Real-World Applications

### Land Measurement
- Survey planning and validation
- Property boundary verification
- Land asset management
- Environmental monitoring

### LiDAR Analytics
- Coverage verification
- Data completeness checking
- Area-based density analysis
- Project scoping

### Cost Estimation
- Per-acre processing costs

## Technical Specifications

### Conversion Accuracy
- **US Survey Foot precision**: 0.3048006096 m/ft
- **Acre definition**: International acre (43,560 sq ft)
- **Meter-based conversion**: 4,046.8564224 sq m/acre
- **Calculation precision**: Floating-point (double)

### Performance Impact
- Negligible (acreage calculated during density computation)
- No additional lasinfo calls required
- Uses existing bounds data

### Compatibility
- ✅ Works with any coordinate system

✅ Correct unit conversion applied (feet → acres)
✅ Total acreage: 170.21 acres verified
✅ Individual file acreages accurate
✅ Displayed in summary.html (stat card + table)
✅ Displayed in lasdetails.html (per file)
✅ No linting errors

## Example Calculations

### cloud0.las (US Survey Feet)
```
Bounds:
  X: 2,960,638.33 to 2,961,572.72 (934.39 ft)
  Y: 340,245.21 to 341,312.22 (1,067.01 ft)

Area calculation:
  Area = 934.39 × 1,067.01 = 996,901 sq ft

Acreage:
  Acreage = 996,901 / 43,560 = 22.89 acres ✅

Points per acre:
  Points per acre = 88,977,761 / 22.89 = 3,887,647 pts/acre
```

## Future Enhancements

Optional additions:
- Hectare units (metric alternative to acres)
- Points per acre statistics
- Land coverage percentage
- Export acreage to CSV
- Acreage ranges/buckets for analysis

## Conclusion

Acreage calculation provides:
- ✅ **Complete area information** for each LAS file
- ✅ **Aggregate land coverage** statistics
- ✅ **Unit-aware conversion** handling
- ✅ **Professional reporting** with new metrics
- ✅ **Real-world applicability** for surveying

The tool now provides comprehensive land measurement data alongside point cloud metrics!
