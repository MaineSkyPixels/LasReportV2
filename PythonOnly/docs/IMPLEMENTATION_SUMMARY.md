# Implementation Summary: Smart Resource Management & Disk I/O Monitoring

## Overview
Completed implementation of a sophisticated resource management system for LAS file processing with real-time disk I/O monitoring, intelligent multi-threading, and user-friendly preflight warnings.

---

## Phase 1: System Utilities Enhancements (`system_utils.py`)

### New Functions Added:

#### 1. **File Size Validation**
```python
validate_file_size(file_path: Path, max_size_gb: float = 20.0) -> Tuple[bool, str]
```
- Validates individual LAS files against 20GB hard limit
- Returns validation status and descriptive message
- Used to prevent processing of oversized files

#### 2. **RAM Estimation**
```python
estimate_total_ram_needed(file_paths: List[Path]) -> float
```
- Calculates total RAM required for batch processing
- Assumes 1.5x file size (file data + XY coordinate arrays)
- Returns estimated RAM in GB

#### 3. **Optimal Thread Calculation**
```python
calculate_optimal_threads(total_ram_needed_gb: float, available_ram_gb: float, 
                         use_convex_hull: bool = False) -> int
```
- Intelligently calculates thread pool size based on available RAM
- Base threads: 12 (normal), 4 (convex hull - more RAM intensive)
- Scales down if RAM usage would exceed 50% of available RAM
- Ensures responsive processing without memory contention

#### 4. **Disk I/O Monitoring Class**
```python
class DiskIOMonitor:
    def update() -> float      # Update and return current speed
    def get_speed() -> float   # Get smoothed average speed
    def reset()                # Reset for new cycle
```
- Monitors process-level disk I/O using `psutil`
- Maintains rolling average of last 10 samples for smoothing
- Returns disk speed in MB/s
- Properly handles edge cases and exceptions

#### 5. **File Size Formatting**
```python
format_file_size(bytes_size: int) -> str
```
- Converts bytes to human-readable format (B, MB, GB, TB, PB)

---

## Phase 2: Processor Updates (`processor.py`)

### Enhanced File Processing:

#### 1. **Cancellation Support**
- Added `cancel_event` (threading.Event) to `LASProcessor.__init__`
- New method: `cancel_processing()` - instantly terminates all threads
- Checked in main processing loop to support user cancellation

#### 2. **File Size Validation**
- All files validated at start of `process_files()` against 20GB limit
- Files exceeding limit marked with error and skipped
- Clear error messages logged for oversized files

#### 3. **Intelligent Thread Pool Sizing**
- Calculates optimal threads before processing begins
- Uses actual available RAM and total file sizes
- Automatically scales workers up/down based on RAM availability
- Logs recommendations for debugging

#### 4. **Decimation Removal**
- Completely removed all point decimation logic
- Always uses 100% of points for convex hull calculation
- Removed `_decimate_points()` method (no longer needed)
- Simplified convex hull code by removing decimation parameters
- Updated logging to indicate "100% - no decimation"

### Key Changes to Methods:

**`process_files()`:**
- Validates all files before processing
- Calculates optimal thread count
- Supports cancellation with event checking
- Returns early with error details for invalid files

**`_calculate_convex_hull_acreage()`:**
- Removed all decimation calculations
- Simplified to: read file → extract XY points → compute hull
- Clearer logging indicating 100% data usage
- More predictable RAM usage (no adaptive decimation surprises)

---

## Phase 3: Main Application Flow (`main.py`)

### Preflight Dialog System:

#### New Method: `show_preflight_dialog()`
Displays before processing with:
- Number of files to process
- Total size in GB
- Available vs. estimated RAM needed
- Convex hull status (enabled/disabled)
- Recommended thread count
- ⚠️ Warning if RAM usage > 50% of available
- Proceed/Cancel buttons

#### Updated `run_scan()` Method:
1. Finds LAS files
2. **Shows preflight dialog** (new!)
3. User can cancel before processing begins
4. Initializes `DiskIOMonitor` for real-time speed tracking
5. Enhanced progress callback with disk speed updates
6. Proper error handling with `try/finally`

### Integration Points:

**Progress Callback:**
```python
def progress_callback(completed, total, filename):
    disk_monitor.update()                    # Update speed
    speed_mbs = disk_monitor.get_speed()     # Get current speed
    gui.update_progress(completed, total)    # Update file progress
    gui.update_disk_speed(speed_mbs)         # Update speed display
    gui.update_stats_label(...)              # Update live stats
    if gui.cancel_requested:
        processor.cancel_processing()        # Trigger cancellation
```

---

## Phase 4: GUI Enhancements (`gui.py`)

### New UI Components:

#### 1. **Disk I/O Speed Bar**
- Visual progress bar showing disk speed relative to expected max
- Real-time text label showing speed in MB/s (e.g., "45.3 MB/s")
- Helps users understand that processing is active even on slow I/O

#### 2. **Real-time Statistics Label**
```
File 5/12 • RAM: 18.2GB/32.0GB • Speed: 45.3 MB/s
```
- Shows current file progress (X/Y)
- Shows estimated RAM usage
- Shows current disk I/O speed
- Updates every progress callback (~500ms frequency)

#### 3. **Processing Mode Control**
New method: `set_processing_mode(active: bool)`
- Disables Start button during processing
- Enables Cancel button during processing
- Prevents duplicate scans
- Clear user feedback on application state

### New Methods:

**`update_disk_speed(speed_mbs, max_expected_speed)`**
- Updates disk speed display with moving text
- Scales progress bar to max expected speed
- Triggers UI updates

**`update_stats_label(file_num, total_files, est_ram, avail_ram, speed)`**
- Updates live statistics display
- Shows all key metrics in one line
- Formatted for readability

**`set_processing_mode(active)`**
- Controls button states during processing
- Manages cancel request flag
- Provides visual feedback
