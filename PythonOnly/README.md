## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Python Dependencies** (see requirements.txt):
  - laspy==2.6.1 (for LAS file reading and analysis)
  - scipy==1.13.0 (for convex hull computation)
  - numpy>=1.20.0 (for numerical calculations)
  - psutil==5.9.8 (for system monitoring)
  - customtkinter==5.2.2 (for modern GUI)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

Or on Windows, use the convenience launcher:
```bash
run.bat
```

A GUI window will appear:
1. Click "📁 Browse" to select a folder containing LAS files
2. (Optional) Check "Calculate detailed acreage using convex hull" for more accurate footprint-based acreage
3. (Optional) Adjust "Performance Tuning" slider to control speed/accuracy tradeoff
   - 100% (1:1) = All points (accurate, slower)
   - 50% (2:1) = Every 2nd point (balanced, 2x faster)
   - 10% (10:1) = Every 10th point (fast, 10x faster)
4. Click "▶ Start Scan" to begin processing
4. The application will:
   - Recursively find all .las files
   - Run lasinfo on each file in parallel (12 concurrent threads)
   - Optionally calculate convex hull acreage if enabled (slower)
   - Generate two HTML reports in the source directory
   - Update progress in real-time
5. Reports are created alongside the LAS files:
   - `summary.html` - Overview with aggregate metrics and acreage comparison
   - `lasdetails.html` - Detailed information for each file
6. Click "📁 Open Reports Folder" to access the generated reports

## Output

Reports are generated in the same directory as the scanned LAS files:

- **summary.html**: 
  - Total files scanned / successful processing
  - Total points across all files
  - Average point density (pts/m²)
  - Overall geographic bounds
  - CRS/EPSG information for each file
  - **Acreage comparison**: Bounding box vs. convex hull (if calculated)
  - Detailed table with per-file metrics

- **lasdetails.html**:
  - Individual file statistics
  - Complete lasinfo output for each file
  - Collapsible sections for easy navigation
  - **Acreage methods**: Shows both bounding box and convex hull acreage when available
  - Error handling for failed files

- **Logging** (`.las_analysis_logs/`):
  - Timestamped log files for each scan
  - DEBUG level logging with raw lasinfo output
  - Detailed error reporting and recovery information

## Technical Details

- **Threading**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor (12 workers) for parallel Python-based LAS processing
- **Coordinate System Handling**: 
  - Automatic CRS detection from LAS file metadata
  - Support for US Survey Feet, International Feet, and Meters
  - Point density calculation with proper unit conversion
- **Parser**: Extracts key metrics from LAS files using Python libraries including:
  - Point count
  - Bounds (X, Y, Z min/max)
  - Point density (with CRS-aware calculation)
  - Scale factors and offsets
  - CRS/EPSG information
  - Point format version
  - File statistics
- **Performance**: ~1-5 seconds per file depending on size; 3x faster with 12 concurrent threads
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with safe defaults and graceful degradation
- **Python-Only Processing**: Uses laspy, scipy, and numpy for all LAS file analysis - no external executables required
