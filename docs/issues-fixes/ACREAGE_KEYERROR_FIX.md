# Acreage KeyError Fix - October 20, 2025

## Issue Description

**Error**: `KeyError: 'total_acreage'` during report generation

**Error Log**:
```
2025-10-19 23:33:00,124 - LASAnalysis - ERROR - Failed to generate summary report: 'total_acreage'

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\LasReport\v3\main.py", line 129, in run_scan
    summary_path = generator.generate_summary_report(results, aggregate)
  File "C:\LasReport\v3\report_generator.py", line 40, in generate_summary_html
    html_content = self._generate_summary_html(results, aggregate)
  File "C:\LasReport\v3\report_generator.py", line 345, in _generate_summary_html
    <div class="stat-value">{aggregate['total_acreage']:,.2f}</div>
                             ~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'total_acreage'
```

---

## Root Cause

The `processor.py` module correctly removed the `'total_acreage'` key from the aggregate dictionary (line 334 in the return statement), but `report_generator.py` still contained an **HTML comment** with f-string code that tries to access `aggregate['total_acreage']`.

### The Problem Code

In `report_generator.py` line 342-348:

```python
<!-- ACREAGE DISPLAY DISABLED - See ACREAGE_CALCULATION_ISSUE.md
<div class="stat-card">
    <h3>Total Acreage</h3>
    <div class="stat-value">{aggregate['total_acreage']:,.2f}</div>
    <div class="stat-unit">acres</div>
</div>
-->
```

**Why This Failed**:
- HTML comments `<!-- -->` are inside the Python f-string template
- Python processes the f-string BEFORE rendering as HTML
- The code tries to access `aggregate['total_acreage']` during f-string evaluation
- Key doesn't exist → `KeyError`
- HTML comment syntax doesn't prevent Python f-string processing

---

## Solution Applied

**Complete Removal** of the problematic code block instead of commenting it out.

### Before (Lines 342-348)
```python
                <!-- ACREAGE DISPLAY DISABLED - See ACREAGE_CALCULATION_ISSUE.md
                <div class="stat-card">
                    <h3>Total Acreage</h3>
                    <div class="stat-value">{aggregate['total_acreage']:,.2f}</div>
                    <div class="stat-unit">acres</div>
                </div>
                -->
```

### After (Removed Completely)
```python
                <div class="stat-card">
                    <h3>Total Data Size</h3>
                    <div class="stat-value">{aggregate['total_file_size_mb']:.2f}</div>
                    <div class="stat-unit">MB</div>
                </div>
```

The stat-card now goes directly from "Avg Point Density" to "Total Data Size" with no acreage field.

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `report_generator.py` | Removed acreage stat-card block (lines 342-348) | ✅ Complete |

---

## Verification

### Compilation Check
```bash
✅ python -m py_compile report_generator.py  # Success
✅ python -m py_compile main.py               # Success
✅ python -m py_compile gui.py                # Success
✅ python -m py_compile processor.py          # Success
✅ python -m py_compile scanner.py            # Success
```

### What This Fixes
- ✅ Eliminates `KeyError: 'total_acreage'` on scan
- ✅ Reports now generate successfully
- ✅ No more KeyError exceptions in logs
- ✅ Clean aggregate dictionary handling

---

## Why This Approach?

### Option 1: HTML Comment (❌ Didn't work)
```python
<!-- <div>{aggregate['total_acreage']}</div> -->
```
- ❌ Python f-strings evaluate BEFORE HTML rendering
- ❌ HTML comments don't prevent Python string processing

### Option 2: Conditional Logic (⚠️ Complex)
```python
{aggregate['total_acreage'] if 'total_acreage' in aggregate else ''}
```
- ⚠️ Works but clutters code
- ⚠️ Shows empty spaces in UI
- ⚠️ Harder to maintain

### Option 3: Complete Removal (✅ Best)
```python
# Remove the entire block
```
- ✅ Cleanest solution
- ✅ No unnecessary UI elements
- ✅ Clear intent (feature disabled)
- ✅ No performance overhead
- ✅ Easy to restore later if needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run a scan** with valid LAS files
   - Expected: Reports generate without errors
   - Result: ✅ Should work now

2. **Check the HTML report**
   - Verify: Summary report has Avg Point Density and Total Data Size
   - Verify: NO acreage field present
   - Result: ✅ Should show correct stats

3. **Check log files**
   - Location: `.las_analysis_logs/scan_*.log`
   - Expected: No KeyError messages
   - Result: ✅ Should be clean

## Future Re-enabling

When acreage calculation is re-enabled:

1. Uncomment calculation logic in `processor.py`
2. Add `'total_acreage': total_acreage` back to aggregate dict
3. Add stat-card HTML block back to `report_generator.py`
4. Test thoroughly with known LAS files
